## Introduction

Documenting data pipelines is hard. Not only is it complex, but it's also time consuming. When working with big teams it becomes near impossible; documentation becomes out of date as soon as it's completed as there's continuous change. **FlowSQL** hopes to remedy this by allowing you to generate flow diagrams programatically. This allows for reproducable, clear diagrams, which are built with [diagrams.net](diagrams.net) so are also easily shared and edited.


## Features

A few of the things you can do with FlowSQL:

* Generate flow diagrams from `.sql` files
